A Microsoft Edge (Chromium) browser extension for intercepting and modifying HTTP requests and responses in real time — built with TypeScript and Manifest V3.

## Features

- **Header Rules** — Add, modify, or remove request and response headers
- **URL Redirect** — Redirect matching requests to a different URL
- **Query Parameters** — Add, modify, or remove URL query parameters
- **Mock API** — Intercept requests and return synthetic responses (no server needed)
- **Response Override** — Replace response bodies with custom content
- **Cookie Rules** — Inject or remove cookies on matching requests
- **Environments** — Define variable sets (`{{BASE_URL}}`, `{{AUTH_TOKEN}}`) and switch between Development / Staging / Production in one click
- **History** — Live log of every request modification
- **Import / Export** — Share rule sets as JSON files
- **Light & Dark theme** — Follows system preference or manually selectable
- **Command Palette** — `Ctrl+K` for instant navigation

## Installation (Developer / Unpacked)

> The extension is not yet published to the Edge Add-ons store. Load it manually:

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vishnoiakash/RequestPilot.git
   cd RequestPilot
   ```

2. Install dependencies and build
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

3. Load in Microsoft Edge
   - Open `edge://extensions/`
   - Enable **Developer mode** (toggle, top-right)
   - Click **Load unpacked**
   - Select the `RequestPilot` folder (the root — where `manifest.json` lives)

4. Click the RequestPilot icon in the toolbar to open the popup, or right-click → **Options** for the full UI

## Development

```bash
# One-time build
npm run build

# Watch mode (recompiles TypeScript on save)
npm run watch

# Build and run automated checks
npm run check

# Create a clean store upload ZIP
npm run package
```

After any change, go to `edge://extensions/` and click the **reload** icon on the RequestPilot card.

## How It Works

### Header / Redirect / Query Param / Cookie Rules
These use the browser's native [`declarativeNetRequest`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/declarativeNetRequest/) API. Rules are compiled and applied as dynamic DNR rules every time you save or toggle a rule. No page reload required — changes take effect on the next matching request.

### Mock API & Response Override
These use a two-part content-script architecture. An isolated-world bridge reads extension storage and sends minimal validated configuration to a `MAIN`-world interceptor that wraps `window.fetch` and `window.XMLHttpRequest`. The page never receives extension API access.

### Environment Variables
Use `{{KEY}}` placeholders in any rule field. The active environment's variables are resolved before rules are applied. Switch environments from the popup or the Environments page.

## Permissions Used

| Permission | Why |
|---|---|
| `storage` | Persist rules, settings, environments, history |
| `declarativeNetRequestWithHostAccess` | Apply dynamic rules to all URLs |
| `webRequest` | Observe request metadata for local history in packaged/store builds; it never blocks or changes requests |
| `<all_urls>` host permission | Apply user-created rules on the sites selected by the user |

## Tech Stack

- **TypeScript** — strict mode, ES2020 target
- **Manifest V3** — service worker background, declarativeNetRequest
- **Zero runtime dependencies** — no frameworks, no bundler
- **Lucide-style inline SVG icons**
- **CSS custom properties** — full light/dark design system
